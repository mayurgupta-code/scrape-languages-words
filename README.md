# scrape-languages-words
Here I scrapes the 1000 words of 100 different languages each using selenium. Also, you can find the script here I used Jupyter Notebook.

Afterwards, each 1000 words are stored in separate txt files but then I made a script to create a dataframe from that txt files. That .ipynb file is also included here.
